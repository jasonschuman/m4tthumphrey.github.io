          <h1>About me</h1>

          <img src="img/matt_bw.jpg" class="img-right">

          <p>I have been working with PHP for about 12 years and professionally for the last 8 of them. I have never been to university and am completely self taught. <a href="#">I don't believe you need a degree</a> to work in this fine industry I have been lucky enough to have found myself in.</p>

          <p>After working for several web design agencies I decided to make the switch to freelancing in 2011. TL;DR: <a href="#">It didn't work out</a>.</p>

          <p>I started working full time with the infamous PHP framework, Magento in May 2012. Magento and I had <a href="http://www.gxjansen.com/my-life-with-magento/" target="_blank">a love hate relationship</a> and I'm sure many other Magento engineers claim the same. Unfortunately it was probably 80:20 in favour of hate.</p>

          <p>Towards the end of 2012 I was tasked with streamlining the deployment process. This led me on a path to <a href="http://gitlab.org">Gitlab</a> which has further introduced me to <a href="#">Ruby</a>. I have also started working with Ruby, and Rails in particular on a side project and have <a href="#">been finding it a true joy</a> to work with. I am also trying out Chef with Vagrant as much as I can for testing and deployment.</p>

          <p>I have just started working full time at <a href="http://www.windsor-telecom.co.uk">Windsor Telecom</a>, working on a variety of applications for clients in the in the Telecoms industry. I am very excited about this role and am looking forward to sharing my experiences with you all.</p>

          <p>You can find me in <a href="https://twitter.com/m4tthumphrey" title="Matt Humphrey on Twitter">many</a> <a href="https://github.com/m4tthumphrey">places</a> <a href="http://letterboxd.com/m4tthumphrey">online</a>, usually under the handle <em>m4tthumphrey</em>.</p>
