          <h1>About me</h1>

          <img src="img/matt_bw.jpg" class="img-right">

          <p>I have been working with PHP for about 12 years and professionally for the last 8 of them. I have never been to university and am completely self taught. <a href="#">I don't believe you need a degree</a> to work in this fine industry I have been lucky enough to have found myself in.</p>

          <p>After working for several web design agencies I decided to make the switch to freelancing in 2011. TL;DR: <a href="#">It didn't work out</a>.</p>

          <p>I started working full time at <a href="http://www.screenpages.com">Screen Pages</a> with the infamous PHP framework, Magento in May last year. Magento and I have <a href="http://www.gxjansen.com/my-life-with-magento/" target="_blank">a love hate relationship</a> and I'm sure many other Magento engineers claim the same. Unfortunately it is probably 80:20 in favour of hate. This is one of main reasons for this blog, so I can share my <a href="#">experiences with Magento</a>, for good <em>and</em> for bad.</p>

          <p>Whilst working at Screen Pages I completed the Magento Developer Certfication. I have strong views on certification exams, the <a href="#">MDC</a> in particular.</p>

          <p>Towards the end of 2012 I was tasked with streamlining our deployment process. This led me on a path to <a href="#">Gitlab</a> which has further introduced me to <a href="#">Ruby</a>. I have also started working with Ruby, and Rails in particular on a side project and have <a href="#">been finding it a true joy</a> to work with. I am also trying to use Chef with Vagrant as much as I can for testing and deployment.</p>

          <p>You will find me in many places online, usually under <em>m4tthumphrey</em>.
