          <h1>About me</h1>

          <img src="img/matt_bw.jpg" class="img-right">

          <p>I have been working with PHP for about 14 years and professionally for the last 8 of them. I have never been to university and am completely self taught. <a href="#">I don't believe you need a degree</a> to work in this fine industry I have been lucky enough to have found myself in.</p>

          <p>After working for several web design agencies I decided to make the switch to freelancing in 2011. TL;DR: It didn't work out.</p>

          <p>I started working full time at <a href="http://www.screenpages.com">Screen Pages</a> with the infamous PHP framework in May last year. Magento and I have a love hate relationship and I'm sure many other Magento engineers claim the same. Unfortunately it is probably 80:20 in favour of hate. This is one of main reasons for this blog, so I can share my <a href="#">experiences with Magento</a>, for good <em>and</em> for bad.</p>

          <p>Whilst working at Screen Pages I completed the Magento Developer Certfication. I have strong views on certification exams, the <a href="#">MDC</a> in particular.</p>

          <p>Towards the end of 2012 I was tasked with streamlining our deployment process. This led me on a path to <a href="#">Gitlab</a> which has further introduced me to <a href="#">Ruby</a>. I have also started working with Ruby, and Rails in particular on a side project and have <a href="#">been finding it a true joy</a> to work with.</p>

          <h2>Tools of the trade</h2>
          <p>I use the following when working with personal projects</p>
          <ul>
            <li>2012 MacBook Air 13". 256SSD. 8GB RAM.</li>
            <li>iTerm 2 with oh my zsh!</li>
            <li>JetBrains have made a small fortune from me; forking out personal licenses for both PHPStorm and RubyMine. I cannot recommend these IDEs enough.</li>
            <li>I use Sublime Text 2 for small projects and minor editing.</li>
            <li>PHP projects are hosted with Media Temple, Ruby at Digital Ocean.</li>
            <li>Essential apps include DropBox, TweetBot and Droplr.</li>
          </ul>
