I work with Magento everyday, and with that comes great pain and suffering. I have started this blog to share some of that pain. 

However, with every swing there is a roundabout. In working with Magento, it has set me on a path to Ruby and Rails. How you ask? Well you'll just have to stick around and find out. I have also had the chance to get to know Git properly in developing our deployment system.

As well as Magento I'll be talking about some of the methods and technologies we use at Screen Pages and in my personal projects.
